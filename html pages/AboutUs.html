<p>Makkah International School (MIS) operates in a delightful and harmonious ambience; where educational procedures and practices are informed by, and predicated on; demands of curriculum, instruction and assessment; as we teach and learn every day. 
Fruitful collaboration and healthy partnership with stakeholders exist as we meet the pervasive demands of: school climate; programs; support services; and the totality of the multifarious activities that give us our definition as MIS.
We also demonstrate our disposition to face contemporary developments in education, achieve results and accomplish our objectives without compromising our obligations to stakeholders and society.This is MIS at a glance.</p>

<h3 id="Students">Students</h3>
<p>At its inception with 13 students, the student population at MIS has risen to 1,800 to date, from 49 different countries. 
Increasing numbers of our students graduate with high school diplomas every year and many of them have been admitted to colleges and universities, especially in the USA. 
There is an alumni association with over 300 registered members who are ever prepared to help in the school’s development efforts.  To adequately prepare our students for college, 
as a complement to our internal assessment strategies, and also give them international exposure, we have introduced external assessment standardized tests. 
The following are compulsory tests for students: Pre-SAT for Grades 10 & 11; SAT for Grade 12, Stanford 10 Standardized Test for K-12, and World Educational Games in English and Math. </p>

<h3 id="MISBoardGoals">MIS Board Goals</h3>
<p>In pursuance of MIS Board goals of meeting international standards in all educational programs on offer, early efforts were made to seek MSA – CESS accreditation in 2003 which was obtained in 2007. 
After 5 years that ended in 2012, there was another inspection by the MSA – CESS during May 4 - 7, 2012; after which our accreditation status was extended to December, 2019. 
We were also accredited by NWAC in 2011 and have now obtained AdvancED accreditation, which expires in December, 2019.</p>
